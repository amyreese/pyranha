pyranha
=======

Elegant IRC client.

Pyranha aims to be a simple, opinionated and good looking IRC client, with
elegance as the primary design goal for both the implementation and the user
interface.  The user is expected to know enough about IRC and dotfiles to
have the absolute minimum of UI elements; keyboard shortcuts and commands
trump on-screen buttons.  Documentation is of highest importance.

Python, Gtk, Webkit, and YAML.


Planned Features
----------------

- YAML for all configuration and state
- Hot config file editing and reloading
- Inline image preview and URL processing
- Completely styled using CSS
