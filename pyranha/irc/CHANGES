=====

* Added missing events. Fixes #3515578.

0.7
===

* Moved functionality from irclib module to irc.client module.
* Moved functionality from ircbot module to irc.bot module.
* Retained irclib and ircbot modules for backward-compatibility. These
  will be removed in 1.0.
* Renamed project to simply 'irc'.

To support the new module structure, simply replace references to the irclib
module with irc.client and ircbot module with irc.bot. This project will
support that interface through all versions of irc 1.x, so if you've made
these changes, you can safely depend on `irc >= 0.7, <2.0dev`.

=====

* Fixed failing test where DelayedCommands weren't being sorted properly.
  DelayedCommand a now subclass of the DateTime object, where the command's
  due time is the datetime. Fixed issue #3518508.

=====

* Fixed incorrect usage of Connection.execute_delayed (again).

0.6.0

  Fixed issue 3516241.
